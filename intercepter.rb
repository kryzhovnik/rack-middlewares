# Rack::Intercepter middleware helps when you need to intercept a certain request and
# return specific status code for it.
#
# This piece of code was written when the author needed to handle a couple of
# exceptional temporal cases, which was not suited the app business logic even as an exception.
#
# Interception described in the rules table:
#
#     [method, url, status, headers, body]
#
# Example:
#
#     config.middleware.use Rack::Intercepter, [
#       ['GET', 'https://abc.domain.com/path?param=value', 404]
#       ['GET', 'https://abc.domain.com/path?param=value', 302, { 'Location' => https://abc.domain.com/param/value }]
#       ['GET', 'https://abc.domain.com/path?param=value', 403, {}, "Forbidden"]
#     ]
#
# This implementation has a specific feature: matching url ignoring second-level domain-name,
# i.e. the following lines will pass the matching:
#
#     https://abc.domain.com/path Ð¸
#     https://abc.domain.local/path
#
# It made this way to have single rules for all the environments: dev, staging, and production.
